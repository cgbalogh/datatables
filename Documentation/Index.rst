	:Description:
		This extension provides automatic integration of dataTables in your own extension. It renders any list of objects that are accessible as aggregate root domain objects. The configuration is done by FlexForm-settings and the requests to the database backend are performed as ajax queries speeding up the rendering of big record sets. Buttons for editing, deleting and adding records can be added by configuration settings.
