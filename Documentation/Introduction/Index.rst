What does it do?
================

If you are developing your own extbase extension with Extension Builder for Typo3 you will probably need to adjust the plain list view that will be generated by the extension builder. When developing my own extensions I realized that I have to spend much time in adjusting the table views. This inculdes the follwonng tasks:

* Adding or removing columns to deisplay object properties
* Moving columns
* Adding edit/add record and/or delete record buttons
* Display one ore all child objects

The above listed tasks will be completed by using the dataTable plugin for jQuery. Since Typo3 7.6 and later has jQuery already integrated, there is no need for additional tools for providing the following functions:

* Display result pages
* Searching via AJAX-calls for speeding up database queries
* Make columns sortable
* Store the table state
* Use responsive extension for better data rendering on mobile/handheld devices

The whole extension provides a frontend plugin which can be entirely configured via flexforms in the backend thus giving you the possibility to have more than one table on a single page. By adding the plugin the available object repository will be scanned. The only thing you have to do is:

* Selecting the desired repository
* Select the properties to be displayed (also for child and nested objects)
* Add individual display and configuration options if necessary

That's it.
